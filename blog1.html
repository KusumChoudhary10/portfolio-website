        By a girl who just wanted to walk without falling

        I live in Wagholi, Pune—a truly beautiful place. Behind my society, there’s a hill that glows golden during <br>
        sunset. Inside, the buildings surround a four-floor parking tower, and the roads are smooth, wide, and newly <br>
        made.<br>
        But as beautiful as everything looks on the outside, the problems are hiding in plain sight.<br>
        In our parking area, there’s a constant drainage issue. Not because the system is bad—but because<br>
        people throw wrappers, plastic, and all kinds of waste straight into the drains. Every time it rains, the water<br>
        backs up. And every time, someone says, “Arre, drain clog ho gaya,” as if it’s a surprise.<br>
        It’s not. It’s the result of everyday shortcuts and laziness.<br>
