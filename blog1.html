                Engineering is hard — even harder if you’re studying at an Indian engineering college. It can be
                overwhelming, especially if you’re from a Tier-3 college. That’s a truth every Indian student knows
                before joining college, but often there’s no choice but to accept it.<br>
                Not just engineering, but any course you take in India feels like a task, where there’s no escape unless
                you keep your head down in front of your short-tempered professors. And if your professor happens to be
                bald and short-tempered, well — get ready to lose your mind.<br>
                Colleges in India won’t let you live without constantly sprinkling unnecessary assignments.
                As an Indian student, I’m stuck with the same fate — just going to college, sitting through lectures
                that teach almost nothing useful for the future. Not even in engineering.<br>
                We have subjects like “Universal Human Learning” or something like that, but guess what? The college
                doesn’t even arrange proper lectures for it.<br>
                The whole point of that subject is to teach ethics and morals, but who really wants to learn that? The
                teachers just teach whatever they want. Honestly, I don’t think they even want to teach — most of them
                became teachers because they couldn’t find a job in their own field. Many of them graduated from the
                very same university they’re teaching at now.<br>
                We do get classes for some subjects like digital marketing and engineering economics — lucky us. But
                it’s an Indian engineering college, so the teachers teach these topics like bedtime stories for
                toddlers.<br>
                And in India, if you ask a teacher the meaning of a word, you’re basically asking them to translate it
                into your native language.<br>

            <p>
                Because of all this, students are constantly under pressure — from parents, teachers, and their own
                fears about the future. Being a college student isn’t easy. There’s always that stress of not being able
                to study enough, and now that we’re considered “adults,” our parents expect us to start earning too.<br>
                But with a heavy, outdated syllabus, most of us barely get time to build real-world skills — the ones
                we’ll actually need to make money. Forget skill-building, students don’t even get proper time to study
                for exams thanks to endless assignments and pointless tasks.<br>
                Colleges don’t teach the skills that matter. If we want to survive out there, we have to learn them
                ourselves. Most students come into engineering thinking they’ll land a nice IT job and start earning
                big, but the reality is way more brutal — there’s massive competition, and barely anyone is truly
                job-ready.<br>
                Most students end up relying on courses outside of college to fill the skill gap. But let’s be real —
                those courses alone won’t help. If you want a good job, you have to go beyond just watching tutorials.
                You need to build real projects and actually understand what you’re doing.<br>
                Everyone these days is rushing into MERN stack or web development courses. Some dive into DSA, solving
                problems like they’re just checklist tasks — without truly grasping the logic behind them. It becomes
                another rat race.<br>
                And don’t fall for the coaching centres promising internships after you complete their paid course. It’s
                a trap. These places survive on student panic. For them, it’s all business. They don’t care if you
                actually learn — they just want your fees paid on time. That’s it.<br>
                There are tons of online courses that can actually help. YouTube channels, websites, apps — so much good
                content is out there for free. You just need to figure out what works best for you. There are thousands
                of options that can help you build real skills and projects, without spending a rupee.<br>

                I’m an engineering student too — from a tier-3 college that honestly sucks. I know how hard it is to
                juggle the syllabus, never-ending assignments, and the stupid 75% attendance rule.<br>
                Most students don’t even get the branch they actually wanted. In India, your branch is based on your
                rank or percentile in the entrance exam — not your interest or skills. So many brilliant students who
                are great at coding or tech lose out on their preferred field because they weren’t “good enough” in
                chemistry or physics.<br>
                Yeah, that’s India for you. We don’t care about skills or SOPs — just marks.<br>
                If you want a tech job, you’re stuck studying college subjects and learning programming on the side. And
                these college subjects? Just passing them is hard enough. Forget about scoring well.<br>
                What we can do is follow a disciplined routine after college hours and use that time to actually build
                real-world skills. There’s a ton of quality content online — and most of it is free. If you really want
                to grow, resources are not the problem anymore.<br>
                And honestly, it’s not always the system that’s at fault. Sometimes, students are the same. They refuse
                to put in the extra hustle — no practice, no self-learning — and then blame college for not getting them
                a job.<br>
                Some don’t even care about college at all. They just want a degree so they can go run their father’s
                business. That’s fine, but don’t act like the system failed you when you never even tried.<br>
                In the end, Indian engineering colleges won’t hand you success. If you wait for the system to help you —
                you’ll be waiting forever. You have to figure it out yourself. Learn what actually matters. Build
                skills. Be smart about your time.<br>
                It’s tough. It’s frustrating. But if you play it right, you can use these four years to build something
                real — while everyone else is busy crying about their attendance.<br>
                Because let’s be honest — the degree isn’t worthless. It’s just not enough.<br><br>
